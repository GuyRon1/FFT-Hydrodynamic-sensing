# FFT-Hydrodynamic-sensing
1)Dominant Freq analysis(FFT) - Code for plotting FFT spectral graph #Need to make sure it`s written well

2)TrendlineAPP - Code that reads a CSV file and plotting the pressure results from all 3 sensors. Line 25-28 normlize the rezults by the mean value.

3)VortexFittingTutorial - Alex`s code for vortex fitting

4)norm_cross_corellation -  A code i used to learn what cross corellation is, wouldn`t suggest for practical use

5)process_fix - A code i used to learn cross corellation, this code is faster because it uses fft, but no normalizition is in this code.

6)Cross corellation code -  A code i used to try and learn normalizaition - failed attempt.

7)vortex finder -  A code used to detect a vortex, threshhold should be changed according to the experiment.

8)PIV FREQ DETECTION - This code cound the number of vortecies passing through a Area Of intrest
