    "Per Dr. Liberzon suggestion, VortexFitting has its own class `VelocityField` for storing velocity fields. One way to create a variable of this class is to read the field from a NetCDF file. Therefore, the function `pivpyTovf()` from the inter.py file of PIVPY package, takes velocity field in the form of PIVPY class object, saves this field to a NetCDF file (which is stored on the user's computer, user is let to decide what to do with this file afterwords) and reads the NetCDF file into VortexFitting class object. From there, any fucntion from VortexFitting package will be able to work with it."
